Hi,

This repo for 2.42" OLED mod for RM BOXER.

Based on EdgeTX v2.8.4, code for OLED is developed.

"lcd_driver_spi.cpp" at main, copy&paste to your gitpod IDE, compile it.

(EdgeTX/edgetx/blob/v2.8.4/radio/src/targets/taranis/lcd_driver_spi.cpp)

Wiring and hardware photos are attached.

This code may apply X7 family TX, like BOXER, ZORRO, TX12 and POCKET(maybe).

Happy flying!
